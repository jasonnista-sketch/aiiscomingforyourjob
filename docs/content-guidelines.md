# Content Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
- **Direct and confident.** Not corporate, not academic. Like a smart friend who works in tech explaining your career outlook over drinks.
- **Honest but not alarmist.** We're not here to scare people. We're here to help them adapt.
- **Specific over vague.** "AI can draft a 40-page contract in minutes" beats "AI is transforming the legal industry."
- **Cheeky when earned.** The site is called "AI Is Coming For Your Job" — lean into that energy. But the content itself should be genuinely useful.

## Tagline
"Built to help you stay ahead, not fall behind."

## Page Title Format
Use SEO-optimized titles that match what people actually Google:
- "Will AI Replace [Job Title]?" — this is the H1 on every job page
- Meta title: "[Job Title] — How AI Is Changing This Role | AI Is Coming For Your Job"

## Scoring Criteria

### Risk Score (0-100)
"How likely AI is to fully automate core tasks in this job within 5 years."

Base your score on:
- What % of daily tasks can current AI tools already do?
- How physical/interpersonal is the work? (physical = lower risk)
- How regulated is the field? (regulation = slower adoption)
- Are there already production-ready AI tools displacing this work?

Calibration anchors:
- 8% = Electrician (very physical, hard to automate)
- 15% = Registered Nurse (human connection core, AI assists only)
- 35% = Attorney (research/drafting automated, judgment/advocacy not)
- 52% = Paralegal (document review heavily automated)
- 58% = Radiologist (AI reads images, but oversight still needed)
- 82% = Bookkeeper (almost fully automatable)

### Augmentation Score (0-100)
"How much you can level up by learning the AI tools and skills below."

This is the OPPORTUNITY score. High augmentation means:
- Lots of AI tools exist for this role
- Learning them creates measurable competitive advantage
- Early adopters are already pulling ahead

A job can have HIGH risk AND high augmentation (Radiologist: 58% risk, 95% augment).
A job can have LOW risk AND low augmentation (Electrician: 8% risk, 45% augment).

## Writing Each Section

### Summary (2-3 sentences)
Open with the verdict — is this job in trouble, evolving, or safe? Then explain why. Be specific about WHAT AI is doing to this role.

Good: "Partially — the traditional count-and-dispense pharmacist role is being automated rapidly. Robots fill prescriptions faster and more accurately than humans. But clinical pharmacists who counsel patients and manage complex medication regimens are more valuable than ever."

Bad: "AI is having an impact on the pharmacy profession. Some tasks are being automated while others remain important."

### Key Insight (1-2 sentences)
The most interesting, shareable, surprising fact about AI in this role. If someone tweets one thing from the page, it should be this.

Good: "Pharmacy robots can fill 300 prescriptions per hour with zero errors. Pharmacists who still just count pills are in trouble — those who counsel patients are not."

Bad: "AI tools are becoming more common in pharmacies."

### AI Changing Section (2-3 sentences)
Describe the shift happening right now. What's changing and what does the new version of this job look like?

### AI Capability Breakdown
Three tiers — this is the most important content section:

**⚡ Mastered (2-3 items):** Tasks where AI is already better or equal to humans. Be specific about the tools/systems. These should feel slightly alarming.

**🔄 Improving (2-3 items):** Tasks where AI is making progress but humans still lead. Acknowledge the trajectory — these might move to "mastered" in 2-3 years.

**🧠 Human Only (2-3 items):** Tasks that require empathy, physical presence, complex judgment, creativity, or trust. These are the career anchors. Frame them as opportunities, not just leftovers.

### Tools (3-4 per job)
- Must be REAL tools with working URLs
- Prioritize tools specific to this profession over generic AI (ChatGPT is not a "pharmacist tool")
- Include a one-line description of what it does in THIS role's context
- Prefer established products over vaporware

### Skills (4-6 per job)
- Each skill should be actionable and specific
- Map skills to tools where natural (the ↳ Tool Name pattern)
- Include at least one skill that's about the human side (client relationships, ethical judgment, etc.)
- Format: action verb + specific capability

Good: "Oversee and troubleshoot automated dispensing systems while focusing on clinical oversight"
Bad: "Learn about AI"

### FAQ (2-3 per job)
- Use questions people ACTUALLY Google about this job + AI
- Common patterns: "Will AI replace [job]?", "Is [job] still a good career?", "How is AI changing [job]?"
- Answers should be 3-5 sentences, direct, and nuanced
- These are excellent for SEO (FAQ schema)

### Resources (5-8 per job)
- Prioritize: professional associations, peer-reviewed sources, government data
- Include the organization name in the title: "APhA — American Pharmacists Association"
- URLs must be real and current

### Related Careers (3-4 job IDs)
- Pick jobs that someone in this role would naturally be curious about
- Prefer same-industry jobs, but cross-industry is fine if relevant
- The job IDs must exist in data.js

## BLS Stats
Source all employment data from:
- BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OES), May 2024
- BLS Employment Projections 2024-34

Format:
- Salary: "$136,030" (with $ and comma)
- Jobs: "322,200" (with comma)  
- Growth: "+5%" or "-2%" (with sign)
- Growth label: "Growing" (positive), "Stable" (0-1%), "Declining" (negative)

## Content Length Targets
- Summary: 40-60 words
- Key Insight: 20-35 words
- AI Changing: 30-50 words
- Each AI Capability item: 25-50 words for description
- Each FAQ answer: 50-100 words
- Total page content: ~800-1200 words
